1. List each pair of actors that have worked together. ï»¿ Just need to get all the pairs that share some film. 
select fa1.film_id, concat(a1.first_name, ' ', a1.last_name), concat(a2.first_name, ' ', a2.last_name)
from sakila.actor a1
inner join film_actor fa1 on a1.actor_id = fa1.actor_id
inner join film_actor fa2 on (fa1.film_id = fa2.film_id) and (fa1.actor_id != fa2.actor_id)
inner join actor a2 on a2.actor_id = fa2.actor_id;


2. For each film, list actor that has acted in more films. For each film, check the list of actors and get a list with the number of films for each one and take the first one. 

with actor_movies as (
  select actor_id, count(film_id) as num_films
  from film_actor
  group by actor_id
)

select f.title, concat(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) as most_prolific_actor
from (
  select film_id, actor_id, rank() over (
    partition by film_id
    order by num_films
    desc
  ) as m
from film_actor
inner join actor_movies
using (actor_id)) t
inner join actor a on t.actor_id = a.actor_id
inner join film f on t.film_id = f.film_id
where m = 1;



-- Get the the total films for each actor/actress 
with actor_movies as (
  select actor_id, count(film_id) as num_films
  from film_actor
  group by actor_id
)
select f.title, concat(a.first_name, ' ', a.last_name) as best_actor
from (
-- Rank the actors for every movie 
  select film_id, actor_id, rank() over (
    partition by film_id
    order by num_films
    desc
  ) as m
from film_actor
inner join actor_movies
using (actor_id)) t
inner join actor a on t.actor_id = a.actor_id
inner join film f on t.film_id = f.film_id
-- Get only the 'best' actor/actress 
where m = 1;```
